    Butt Pain

    I hate back and butt pain. I have been struggling with it for over a year. Here is my journey.
    <br/><br/>
    For my 24th birthday my girlfriend Leslie bought me tikets to go skydiving. Earlier that month she asked a seemingly honest question: whats on your bucket list?
    I said "uhhh I dont know, maybe sky diving". Little did I know my words would soon haunt me.
    I forgot about this encounter until the day of my birthday. My girlfriend handed me a gift box with a pretty bow on top.
    I rip it open, and inside is a brochure for skydiving! "Wow" I said, as I hugged her and began to worry about the part where I will soon be falling out of the sky.
    <br/><br/>
    That Saturday we drove 1 hour into far north DFW past corn fields and gravel roads into the skyding center.
    Sit here, watch this safety video, sign these documents, sign your right to sue away. I signed and listened to the instructors.
    Once we were trained and signed we got on the plane and I was paired with a young man who was an experienced skydiver, or so I thought.
    I jumped out of the plane with him coaching me along and ... I have got to say the 1 minute of free fall was exchilerating and amazing.
    It was almost worth what happened next. I pulled the rope and the parachute opened no proble, after 3 minutes we were close to the ground.
    I lifted my legs like I was instructed to do so. We neared the ground and ... BAM. My ass hit the ground so hard that the weight of me and this young man git my tailbone.
    Ideally, you scrape the ground and have 5 ft of soft landing, but instead I got a hard thud. I was in pain but the adrenaline was so much I couldnt really understand what was happening.
    "You'll be fine" my guide said. I went home in slight pain and went on about my business. 

    <br/><br/>
    Later that night I kept complaining to my sister that my butt was in deep pain. She said go to the ER and get it checked out ASAP. "Fine", I thought it will give me peace of mind. 
    Keep in mind, this was the first time I ever went to the ER. I did not know what to expect. I see a big room of people waiting for care at 11 PM. I wait. I wait some more, and then I wait even more.

    Finally, at around 1 AM I get a room. 1 hour later I get an x-ray. 1 hour later a nurse walks in and says: "Sir you are fine. There is no fracture on your tailbone, so you can go home. We will write you a perstiption for a pain killer.". 
    "Wow I need to count my blessings. I really dodged a bullet.", I thought as I left the ER. 1 week later I get a bill got $850 dollars AFTER insurance. "What a joke this healthcare system is" I thought as I reluctantly paid the bill.

    <br/><br/>
    The pain from my tailbone didn't go away. It slowly became the worst pain in my fucking ass, quite literally, I have ever experienced up until this point inmy life. Do you know how often you have to sit? 
    You don't really notice until you have a butt injury. Since, the accident I tried a whole slew of things to try and make it feel better. I tried a donut pillow for sitting, which helped a little bit, but not a lot.
    I still use the pillow, but because I have gotten use to it and other flat chairs make me hurt. I tried to sleep with a pillow under my legs when I sleep to help me. I tried a tennis ball rolling on my tailbone.
    I tried going to a physical therapist, but they gave me some pelvic exersices that worked only somewhat. I tried using a muscle hook on my tailbone area to massage the spots that hurt. I tried doing more squats and clute exersices to help. I tried it all. 
    I am writing to you almost one year later from this accident to tell you that I am still in pain and I am still struggling every single day with this. I wouldn't wish this upon anyone. I wish everyone could sit happily and get out of a chair without a huge amount of pain.
    <br/><br/>
    I will tell you that the most effective approaches I have taken were to go to a physical therapist and to use a massage hook to get to the spots of my tailbone issue. I am still not 100%, I wouldnt even say I am 60% cured, but I will not stop.

    Thank you for listening,
