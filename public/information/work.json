These tools will allow users to easily modify and adapt the ways the data is expressed to design and sculpt sound that is aesthetically satisfying and analytically illuminating. UROPs will define and develop a range of practices, then devise digital tools to quickly transform data sets of all types into a variety of sonified results."

      "Abstract: Social Media Platforms (SMPs) use recommendations to provide userswith content [1].  Some standard recommendation techniques can nega-tively affect the way users learn and how much SMPs can profit.  Plat-forms can to have a greedy approach when recommending content to users,which can negatively affect learning and profits.  We align the platform‚Äôsgoals with gaining more money and user‚Äôs goals to learn freely by modify-ing how recommendation systems estimate and recommend to their users.We introduce a new approach for estimating user interests for topics tointroduce diversity and treat users as a learning agent rather than a staticuser.  We found a way that a SMP can focus on these goals to improveusers‚Äô learning experiences and make more profit than current approaches"
